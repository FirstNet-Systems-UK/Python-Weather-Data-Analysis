# Data Analysis with Python

Welcome to the Data Analysis with Python project! This repository contains a hands-on exploration of data analysis techniques using Python, focusing on weather data.

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into practical data analysis tasks using Python. From fundamental commands like `head()` and `shape` to answering specific questions about the weather dataset, we explore data manipulation, descriptive statistics, and deriving meaningful insights.

## Commands Used

- `head()`: Display the initial rows in the dataset.
- `shape`: View the total rows and columns in the dataset.
- `index`: Access the index of the dataframe.
- `columns`: List all column names.
- `dtypes`: Show data types of each column.

...and more.
